<a href="$Rules_channel_link">Server Rules</a>

- Zero tolerance for any discrimination, intolerance, toxicity, etc. Use your common sense.
- Apologize for team kills in ALL CHAT.
- No intentional team killing under any circumstance.
- No asset wasting or griefing.
- No vehicle or aircraft ramming.
- Squad leaders MUST have an SL kit, microphone, and preferably use English.
- DO NOT create squads and immediately give away SL (aka "squad baiting")
- No main camping : if your sole intention is to destroy enemies entering/leaving main you are camping.
- The [TC] tag may only be utilized by Tactical Collective Staff.
- Staff Decision is final, you may always appeal warnings/bans, unless otherwise noted.

<a>Vehicle Claiming Rules</a>
- Vehicles that require crewman or pilot kits must be claimed by a single, dedicated squad.
- The first properly named squad has priority ("Stryker" or "BMP-1" are valid while, "Air", "heli", and "tank" are not).

<a>Seeding Rules</a>
- AFKs are welcome during seeding.
- Fight only over the middle point until the game is live at 50 players or called "LIVE".
- FOBs on the first points for either team may not be destroyed.
- Mortars and emplacements are not allowed.
- Do not camp HABs or farm kills : it goes against the spirit of seeding

<a>Special Forces Mechanics</a>

- Special forces Squad leaders can place their rally on another Squad Leader's rally (buddy rally).
- Special forces still have access to radios but lack large construction capabilities.
- Special forces come equipped with advanced gear and light vehicles, giving them a natural advantage over the enemy.
