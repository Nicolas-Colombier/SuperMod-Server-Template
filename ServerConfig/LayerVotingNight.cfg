// LAYER_VOTING: These must be Layer_Id's; those_are_different from_display names! I.e. 'Belaya_AAS_v1' is correct, 'Belaya AAS v1' is not.
// NOTE: this file is used for servers running in MapRotationMode=LayerVote. This setting can be found in your Server.cfg file (make sure to use a fresh one as your basis).
// NOTE: in-line comments will not work in this config until further notice. Comment lines should be in separate lines, if used.
// NOTE: voting gives option to exclude selected faction from voting pool, I.e. 'SU_AlBasrah_AAS_v1|SU_CAF|SU_RGF'. This will exclude CAF from Team 1 choices and RGF from Team2 choices.
// NOTE: Factions should be available on selected layer, also playing with factions from the same alliance is restricted. If possible voting pool will be empty it will use all possible options on selected layer.
// NOTE: This file will be used only in selected time defined in Server.cfg - NightTime
